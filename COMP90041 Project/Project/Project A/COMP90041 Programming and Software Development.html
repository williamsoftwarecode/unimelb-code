<i>Overall comments from marker</i>:<p>


<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
Add some overall comments. Possible phrases like:

:-)
Nice work!
You seem to be on top of it all.
Looks like you had fun.
I liked the way you did xxx.

But there are still some areas for you to focus on: xxx.
But you need to be careful with xxx.
But note, it isn't really ok to xxx.

Perhaps take a look at the text for examples of this in xxx.
There are programs on the LMS that might help, Exercise xxx perhaps.

Try and mix it up and vary them as much as possible, students will
compare, and it is important that they get _their_ feedback, not
something perceived as being generic.
